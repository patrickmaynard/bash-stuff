# bash-stuff
This repository holds various handy bash shortcuts that I use.

It's now somewhat out-of-date, as I mostly use zsh these days. To install most of the most useful stuff in zsh, do this:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

... or, on bash:

```
bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

TODOs:

* Safely alias something like  open -a PHPStorm path/to/file.php  per http://best-mac-tips.com/2014/06/27/osx-texteditor-terminal-command-line/
